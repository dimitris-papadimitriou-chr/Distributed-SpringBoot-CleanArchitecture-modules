**RabbitMQ server** 

In order to be able to use the sample you must have installed the RabbitMQ server to the machine you plan to run the sample .There are [various downloads on the RabbitMQ site](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html). Unfortunately, you should also have installed [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/downloads). The RabbitMQ installation will ask you to install erlang if you have not.

If the RabbitMQ server is not running you will get an error log from the web-api project when you try to run it.
